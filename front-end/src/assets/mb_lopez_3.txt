Mission Business #3
Aloha   !
I hope that you and   had a productive week. My wife and I were reading from the Book of Mormon last night the account of the missionary work of the sons of Mosiah.
Alma 17:11 "And the Lord said unto them also: Go forth among the Lamanites, thy brethren, and establish my word; yet ye shall be patient in long-suffering and afflictions, that ye may show forth good examples unto them in me, and I will make an instrument of thee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls."
Ammon went to the land of Ishmael- having a determination to "establish" the gospel among the people. I encourage you to review this account and find the answers to the following questions:
1. How did he get to see King Lamoni? What were the ways the Lord prepared the way for him to meet the king?
2. To whom did he officially preached the gospel first in the land of Ishmael? Why?
3. If you were Ammon, would you consider his approach in establishing the Church in your area?
Will you and   study this missionary account of Ammon? Could you make a plan on how you could better establish the Church in   ?
I would love to hear your "accounts" in your letters as you apply the principles you learn from Ammon. May you have a terrific week ahead of you!
With much love,
President Lopez
